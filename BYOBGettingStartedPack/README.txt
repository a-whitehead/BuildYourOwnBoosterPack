==How to use this guide==

This guide contains suggested resources that may or may not assist you in the creation of a custom BoosterPack plug-in module that is compatible with Texas Instruments LaunchPad MCU Evaluation kits. This guide is meant to be helpful to novice hardware designers but may also assist more experienced designers. 

This is a compilation of design resources to get someone started on designing and eventually building their own BoosterPack plug-in module for Texas Instruments LaunchPads. This is a good place to get started, but not an exhaustive list. Designing your hardware is solely your responsibility and proper research into the availabe tools and resources is always a good idea. This list only acts as a suggestion guide. 

The templates available here can help give you a jumpstart with your BoosterPack design process!
